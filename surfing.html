        <h2>My Surfing Journey</h2>
        <p>Surfing has been a passion of mine for many years. It's not just a sport but a way of connecting with nature and finding peace in the ocean's rhythm. I started surfing when I was in the military in Hawaii and have been hooked ever since, chasing waves along coastlines around the world.</p>

              <p>John John Florence is a two-time World Surf League (WSL) champion from Hawaii. He is one of three brothers who are also professional surfers. He stood out amongst them for his discipline to constantly push himself to be better as a kid. If you watch videos of him
                surfing you can see the world class skill, he makes his maneuvers look effortless and easy. </p>
              <br>
              <p>In surfing there are many different kinds of waves. You need a certain board for waves over a certain height, waves for smaller waves, and a board when you're chasing colassal waves. When John John
                started gaining sponsorships John Pyzel began building boards perfected to his needs. When a surfer goes to a competition they will bring their own collection of boards, or a "quiver". Below is John John's
                quiver for when he competes.

              <p>Koa Rothman is a fearless big wave surfer from the North Shore of Oahu, Hawaii. He gained recognition for riding some of the biggest waves at Pipeline and Teahupo'o. His YouTube channel "This is Livin'" documents his surfing adventures around the world and has gained a massive following among surf enthusiasts.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Koa is a celebrity in the world of surfing so you would think he is always in a need to put on a face for his fans, for him that is not the case.
                He always admits how scared he is when he goes to surf massive waves and talks about his process of easing nerves for surfing 60ft waves, so that should give you a sense of how real and down to earth he is. I admire his drive to chase his fears and put them aside 
                to pursue his passion as a surfer. He's also always breaking his boards because he always chases the danger!

                    <p>You might be thinking that this is the same board as JJF's, but its not. Koa had his Next Step designed with different dimension for his height and body composition. Pipeline is an infamous Wave to surf, and Koa has mastered it. This is his go to board on most days when Pipeline is at its most dangerous where quick reaction times and perfect take off angles are essential.</p>
