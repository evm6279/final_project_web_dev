              <p class="recipe-description">This was probably one of the first recipes I wanted to try make with expensive locally sourced ingredients so I was really excited to make this for my girlfriend.
                this was a very unique lesson with making seafood pasta because i cooked the seafood and pasta separately and served them like that but when you tasted it you could tell. It turns out you should cook them together 
                atleast for a little bit so that they can marry their flavors.

                 Hollandaise is a tricky sauce because its very delicate and easy to overcook or under/over season. It's taken me a lot of iterations to get something with the correct consistency and flavor. </p>

              <p class="recipe-description">This recipe i found on Instagram really caught my eye and wanted to make right away. It's supposed to be similar
                in texture and taste of Takoyaki but it uses Canned Tuna and Rice. Unfortunately i did not have Bonito flakes so I couldnt get the presentation all the way down
                but it was funny to make a budget version of one of my favorite appetizers. It also tasted pretty good for using completely wrong ingredients.

          <div class="tip">
            <h3>Mise en Place</h3>
            <p>Preparing and organizing all ingredients before cooking has revolutionized my kitchen workflow. It reduces stress and prevents mistakes when timing is critical.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="tip">
            <h3>Salt Early and Often</h3>
            <p>Properly seasoning food throughout the cooking process, rather than just at the end, creates depth of flavor that can't be achieved any other way.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="tip">
            <h3>Invest in Good Knives</h3>
            <p>A few high-quality, well-maintained knives make cooking more enjoyable and efficient than a drawer full of mediocre ones.</p>
