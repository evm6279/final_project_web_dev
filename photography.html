        <h2>My Photography Journey</h2>
        <p> My family is a mix of creativity and logical thinking. My father and much of his side of the family used to take photos and paint quite professionally, so I took inspiration 
            from a drive to do something similarly to them. Photography has been a way for me to express my creative side and force me to use that side of my brain. As an Electrical Engineering major we dont really need to use our creativity unless were trying to imagine 
            what an electromagnetic wave might look like and how it travels through space. Lately my girlfriend has pushed me to travel which i have been grateful for because it's allowing me to see the beauty of the world
            while i still have the energy.

          <h3>My Portfolio</h3>
          <p>I found the biggest challenge in photography is capturing the beauty of what you see before you, and portraying the emotions it makes you feel. I'm still very much a beginner but here is a very small collection of the hundreds
            photos that i've taken and that im most proud of.

                    a dark photo look good. I recognized i was exploiting that and wanted to diversfy my skillset and forced myself to atleast change the undertones if i was going to do that.

                <li><strong>Xander Budnick:</strong> Here is someone who markets himself as an outdoorsman, but went to school for cinematography so he has a calming and surreal aspect to his content filming the great outdoors.</li>
                <li><strong>John John Florence:</strong> Yes, the same surfer i mentioned in the surfing section also makes some breathtaking content in the world of surfing. It's not him exactly thats shooting and editing the videos but his team has a serious skill for cinematography and if you look them up on YouTube you would see what im talking about.</li>
                <li><strong>Koa Rothman:</strong> His filmer also makes great content for Koa and the quality of videos that they put out make watching his vlogs always interesting.</li>
