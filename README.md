# final_project_web_dev
final project for Web Development class

Thinking of doing a website about my hobbies, one page on surfing, one page on motorcycles, one page on photography, one page on cooking, and probably more pages on my hobbies. Might include my military service but dont want to get too controversial and make enemies
